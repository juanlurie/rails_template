{"name":"Rails Template","body":"### Bootstrap a New Application\r\nThis is a simple Ruby on Rails template to get you going with Devise/RSpec/Cucumber/HAML and the Twitter Bootstrap. It provides some useful defaults, helpers and sets you up for a quick Heroku deployment with Amazon S3 support as well. Here's how to use it:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ rails new APP_NAME -T -d mysql -m https://github.com/tonycoco/rails_template/raw/master/rails_template.rb\r\n```\r\n\r\nDone. Let the app install and you have yourself a starter-kit for a new exciting application.\r\n\r\n### Customization\r\nLook for all instances of the string \"CHANGEME\" in the generated application and make sure you have the following setup on your system:\r\n\r\n```\r\nENV['FACEBOOK_APP_ID']\r\nENV['FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET']\r\nENV['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID']\r\nENV['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY']\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Roll Your Own\r\nFork it. Use it. Make it your own. If you are customizing this template, you can use any methods provided by Thor::Actions and Rails::Generators::Actions\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\nThis is not yet finished. There has been continuous development on it. I do keep the master branch always in a working state. I'm in the middle of adding tests to track the output of the template, but that may be overkill.","tagline":"Bootstrap a Ruby on Rails application","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
